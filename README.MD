## Description

React.js is the most popular JavaScript library used to create modern, reactive user interfaces for the web. This course teaches React in-depth, step by step, from the basics to advanced concepts. The course includes theory, tons of examples and demos, assignments and exercises, and crucial knowledge that is often skipped by other resources.

The course is up-to-date with React 18, the latest version of React, and offers two paths to choose from: the "complete" path (full >40h course) and the "summary" path (~4h summary module).

## Prerequisites
The course requires fundamental knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You do not need to be an expert in JavaScript to take this course. Basic knowledge of ES6+ JavaScript is beneficial but not mandatory. You do not need any prior React or any other JS framework experience to take this course.
